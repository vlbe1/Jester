  "description"  : "Once a fool, now a fiend. The Jester served long as Pig’s court clown, until cruelty and beatings drove him into exile. Twisted by humiliation, he returns with an army of mockery and malice. His soldiers, inspired by Pig and shaped by years of watching battles, march to avenge their broken master. Beware – the fool no longer plays for laughs.",
